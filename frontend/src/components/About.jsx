        Are you having a hard time finding new books to read? Worry no more -
        this tool is here to help!
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this app, you'll be able to find new reads quicker than ever,
        using AI.
      </p>

      <h2 className="h5">How to use the app</h2>
      <p>
        The idea is simple - you provide the title and author of your book to
        the input, such as, "Dracula by Bram Stoker", and it spits out similar
        books of that nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can "Like" books. Liking a particular book saves it for later in the
        "Saved books" section.
      </p>

      <h2 className="h5">Why did I create this app?</h2>
      <p>
        When I am done with a book, I sometimes want to find something similar
        to read, on the same vein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsing online just doesn't cut it - I find I spend more time looking
        for that "perfect book" than actually reading.
      </p>
      <p>This is where the idea for this app came.</p>
